            <h1 class="center bold">What is artistic gymnastics?</h1>
        </b>
            Artistic gymnastics is a highly skilled sport that combines strength, agility, flexibility, 
            and balance. Athletes perform short routines on various apparatus, showcasing their physical 
            ability and control. Women's events include the vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor 
            exercise, while men compete in six events: floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, 
            parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Introduced in 1894, artistic gymnastics was one of the 
            original disciplines in the modern Olympic Games and has remained a centerpiece of international 
            competition. The sport is governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), which
            sets the Code of Points used to judge routines and ensures consistent rules worldwide. Within 
            individual countries, national federations like USA Gymnastics and British Gymnastics organize 
            and support athletes at all levels. Artistic gymnastics challenges individuals to perform with
            precision, power, and grace, making it one of the most demanding and captivating sports in the
            world.

            Women's artistic gymnastics (WAG) is a sport that showcases a combination of strength, 
            grace, flexibility, and precision. Female gymnasts compete on four apparatus: vault, 
            uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. While women's gymnastics also requires
            great athleticism, it places more emphasis on fluid movement, rhythm, and artistry—
            especially in events like beam and floor. Dance elements, leaps, and expressive 
            choreography are important components that distinguish women's routines from men's. 
            Women's gymnastics became an Olympic sport in 1928 and has grown in popularity
            worldwide, inspiring generations with its blend of power and elegance.

                <ul><h3>Womens events in olympic order.</h3>
                    <li><h4>Vault</h4>
                        <ul>
                            Similar to the men's vault, this event involves a fast sprint down a runway, a jump off the springboard, and an aerial flip or twist over the vaulting table. It's judged based on height, form, and the gymnast's ability to stick the landing.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Uneven Bars</h4>
                        <ul>
                            A visually striking event where gymnasts swing, transition, and release between two bars set at different heights. It requires rhythm, body control, and precise timing during high-flying skills and complex grip changes.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Balance Beam</h4>
                        <ul>
                            Performed on a narrow beam just 4 inches wide, this event tests a gymnast's balance, poise, and concentration. Routines include acrobatic flips, leaps, turns, and dance elements, all executed with grace and confidence.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>Floor</h4>
                        <ul>A mix of tumbling, dance, and choreography performed on a spring floor to music. This is one of the most expressive events in women's gymnastics, where personality and style shine alongside powerful acrobatics and technical skill.

            <p>
                Men's artistic gymnastics (MAG) is a discipline of gymnastics where male athletes
                 perform routines on six apparatus: floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault,
                parallel bars, and horizontal bar. Each event highlights different physical 
                qualities—such as upper body strength on rings, control and rhythm on pommel horse, and 
                explosive power on vault. Men's gymnastics tends to emphasize strength, control, and power, 
                whereas women's gymnastics places more focus on flexibility, artistry, and dance elements, 
                especially on events like beam and floor. This distinction has shaped the development of each
                 discipline over time.</p>
            <p>Men's gymnastics has a long history, dating back to ancient Greece, where physical 
                training was a central part of education and military preparation. It was officially
                 introduced into the modern Olympic Games in 1896 and has been a key part of international
                  competition ever since. Over the decades, the sport has evolved from rigid, 
                  calisthenic-style movements to dynamic and complex routines requiring incredible 
                  athleticism. Today, men's artistic gymnastics continues to push boundaries, with 
                  athletes performing high-difficulty skills that showcase strength, precision, and courage.</p>

                <ul><h3>Mens events in olympic order</h3>
                    <li><h4>Floor</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            Performed on a 12x12 meter spring floor, this event combines powerful tumbling passes, strength moves, and flexibility. Gymnasts are judged on their control, execution, and artistry, though men's routines focus more on strength and acrobatics than dance.
                         </ul>
                    <li><h4>Pommel Horse</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            This event requires incredible upper body and core strength. Gymnasts swing their legs in continuous circular motions while maintaining balance and rhythm, often including difficult skills like flairs and handstands without touching the apparatus with their legs.
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Still Rings</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            Known for its difficulty, the rings event demands exceptional upper body strength and stability. Gymnasts perform strength holds (like the iron cross), swings, and a powerful dismount—all while keeping the rings perfectly still.
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Vault</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            In this event, gymnasts sprint down a runway, spring off a board, and launch themselves over a vaulting table to perform twists and flips in midair. The vault is judged based on speed, form, height, and the landing.
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Parallel Bars</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            Gymnasts perform swings, balances, and flight elements on two parallel bars. This event requires strong coordination, fluid movement, and precision, especially when transitioning between holds and swinging skills.
                        </ul>
                    <li><h4>Horizontal Bar</h4></li>
                        <ul>
                            Athletes perform high-flying routines on a single bar suspended high above the ground. Skills include giant swings, release-and-recatch moves, and complex dismounts. It's one of the most thrilling and dynamic events in men's gymnastics.
                        </ul>
                </ul>
